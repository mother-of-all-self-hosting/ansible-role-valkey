      You need to define a required configuration setting (`{{ item }}`).
  when: "lookup('vars', item, default='') | string | length == 0"
  with_items:
    - valkey_identifier
    - valkey_uid
    - valkey_gid
    - valkey_arch

- name: Fail if Valkey architecture is not supported
  ansible.builtin.fail:
    msg: >-
      Your configuration specifies a CPU architecture (`{{ valkey_arch }}`) which is not currently supported.
      This Valkey role also does not support self-building yet, so it's not possible to make use of it.
  when: "valkey_arch not in ['amd64', 'arm64']"
